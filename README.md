# Emergency
 Emergency Application is a robust and user-friendly mobile application built using the Flutter framework, offering a seamless experience for users seeking immediate assistance in critical situations. With a focus on user safety and well-being, this app enables users to quickly connect with emergency services with just a few taps.

Key Features:
1. **Service Selection:** Emergency App allows users to choose from a range of emergency services, including police, fire, medical, and more. It ensures that the right help is always within reach.

2. **Request a Call:**Users can input their personal details and send a request for the selected emergency service to call them back. This feature not only initiates a call but also collects essential information such as name and phone number. By providing these details, users can ensure a prompt response and receive a return call from the chosen service, even if they're unable to make the call themselves.

3. **Location-Based Assistance:** The app integrates the Location package to provide precise, real-time location information. When requesting assistance, users can share their current location, ensuring that help arrives at the right place, even if they're unable to provide an address.

4. **MVVM Architecture:** Built on the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, Emergency App separates the application's logic from its user interface. This results in a cleaner and more maintainable codebase, making it easier to add new features and ensure app stability.

5. **Provider State Management:** Leveraging the power of Provider state management, the app offers efficient state handling, enhancing responsiveness and ensuring a seamless user experience.

6. **Customized Icon:** Emergency Application features a unique and easily recognizable app icon. The icon reflects the app's purpose and is designed to stand out on the user's device.
